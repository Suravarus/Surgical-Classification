# Surgical-Classification

Machine Learning Classification of a surgical dataset, visualized with Jupyter notebook utilizing a modification allowing for Java code within it.
The notebook is utilizing an IJava Kernel, allowing Java code to execute within the jupyter notebook, I believe if you download the file you will also need the kernel. A very good 
walkthrough of what is occuring is written in the 'Term Project Report.docx' file, it includes screenshots and issues encountered when creating the project initially. Within the 
notebook itself, there is also some good description of the processes being used.

If you have any specific questions about this project, feel free to send me a message and I'll try to assist in any way I can.
